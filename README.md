# Flight-Price-Prediction-AutoML
I have built a simple web app that predicts the price of flights based on inputs such as Airline, Departure date and time, Source and destination, etc. Used TPOT Package which automatically choose a best algorithms and build the model and and deployed using "Streamlit" on Heroku. 

Data Preprocessing is done in Dataiku AutoML Software tool, the dataset are Test_DATASET_1 and TRAIN_DATASET.
